    <h1>A healthy way to look after rabbits</h1>
    <h2>What essentials are neaded for my rabbits?</h2>
    <p>There are many essentials for your rabbits. Some are easy to know, some aren't. Let me tell you the main essentails. 1. Like most living things, rabbits need food. 2. A hutch (indoor or outdoor) 3. Hay 4. Sawdust 5. A bowl -one for water one for food- 6. Cat litter and a litter tray 7. An area when they hide.) 8. If a rabbit is an indoor rabbit it is best to have things that your rabbit can chew on to avoid your furnuture being chewed. 9. Rabbits need alot of attention but they dont tend to like being picked up, however that dosn't mean you can't stroke them. 10. A friend, it is best to buy two rabbits (of the same gender if you don't want your rabbits to have babbies.) </p>

      <h2>What food is best for my rabbits?</h2>
      <p>Vegtables are recommened about 1 small bowl a day. Hay is vital YOU MUST have hay -at all times- in your rabbits reach. Pellets are rabbit food but they are a treat for rabitts. You're rabbits will go crazy for pellets so I would recommend to put the pellets in a sealed plastic box up high. The suggested amount is 1 small adults' handfull per rabbit.</p>

      <h2>What should my rabbits not eat?</h2>
      <p>Rabbits should never eat: root veg or fruit. Toxic food such as: yoghurt drops, bread pasta and cookies. Other food items that you would usually eat on a day-to-day basis: iceburg lettuce, hamster food, walnuts, chocolate, sweets, oatmeal, peanut butter, meat and couliflour. An unusal food item that is toxic to rabbits is silverbeat, which means a beat of a variety with a broad edible white leaf stalks and green blades.</p>

      <h2>What do I do with leftovers?</h2>
      <p>If you've had a healthy family meal and you have leftover vegtables, give them to your rabbits they'd be so happy. Vegtables are good for us as humans, but they keep the rabbits alive for protection.</p>

      <h2>How do I protect my rabbits from foxes, cats and other animals?</h2>
      <p>If your rabbit was a outdoor rabbit then its best to give them a wide, sturdy and defensive hutch. If your rabbit was a indoor rabit, have metal fences around the room were they're indoor hutch is.</p>
